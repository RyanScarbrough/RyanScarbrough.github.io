		<blockquote id="longquote">Newton said that he made his discoveries by 'intending' his mind on the subject;
			no doubt truly. But to equal his success one must have the mind which he 'intended.' Forty lesser men might
			have intended their minds till they cracked, without any like result. It would be idle either to affirm or to
			deny that the last half-century has produced men of science of the calibre of Newton. It is sufficient that
			it can show a few capacities of the first rank, competent not only to deal profitably with the inheritance
			bequeathed by their scientific forefathers, but to pass on to their successors physical truths of a higher order
			than any yet reached by the human race. And if they have succeeded as Newton succeeded, it is because they have
			sought truth as he sought it, with no other object than the finding it. - Thomas Huxley
