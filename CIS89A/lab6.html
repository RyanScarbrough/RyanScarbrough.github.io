		<p>Japan is an island country in the northwest of the Pacific Ocean. Surprisingly it is almost
		the same size as California, being 93% as big. However, its population is 3 times that of California.
		Does that make it crowded? Well, mostly in the Kanto region, due to it housing the booming metropolis that is Tokyo.</p>
		<p>Japan's major religions are Shinto and Buddhism, where Shintos pray and give offerings to spirits
		(Kami) to keep away evil and perform rituals to ignite the divine spark, and Buddhists walk a path
		towards ultimate liberation. These peaceful practices probably play a role in why Japan is considered
		to be so peaceful with very low crime rates.</p>
		<p>When it comes to cuisine, the people of Japan eat mostly whole or minimally processed foods that make
		up a very healthy diet. Primarily fish, seafood, rice, soy, fruit, and vegetables. This diet is often considered
		why Japan's life expectancy is 6 more years than the US!</p>

		<p>Tokyo, Japan's enchanting capital, is a mixture of both modern and traditional cultures. In terms of population
		density, it's around twice that of Los Angeles, CA. The transport system consists of an extensive network of efficient
		trains and subways, getting you from one place to another.</p>
		<p>As for fun there are shrines, temples, huge shopping/dining districts, palaces, beautiful parks & gardens, museums,
		theatres, and even a Disneyland! For most visitors, the biggest part of the Tokyo experience is just wandering around
		and absorbing the vibe.</p>

		<p>Often considered the "Central Park of Tokyo," this garden is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Tokyo.
		The park consists of three different cultural types of gardens in one: Japanese, English, and French! Overall, there
		are more than a total of 20,000 trees covering 144 acres of land.</p>
		<p>If you're a fan of cherry blossom trees, try visiting the Japanese section of the garden during spring, when these
		trees are in full bloom. There are about 1,000 cherry blossom trees, including early and late blooming ones if you miss
		the main season!</p>
